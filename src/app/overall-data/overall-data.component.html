        Looking at Black Friday brick-and-mortar sales and Cyber Monday sales, the trend is clear: Cyber Monday is gaining traction faster than ever, while Black Friday is fading as an outing.

        However, this is not the case for the Thanksgiving weekend as a whole. More and more consumers shop on Thanksgiving Day, as well as online. This is reflected in the brick-and-mortar sales on a flat/slow decline year-over-year. Note that the Black Friday figures do not include "pickup in store" sales, as those are technically done online.

        The real question is, are Black Friday and Cyber Monday actually good for us, the consumers? Or is it just a ploy from the corporations to take more of our hard-earned money by exploiting our consumer mindset?
